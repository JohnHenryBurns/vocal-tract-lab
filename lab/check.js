  // What separates a sibilant from a dental is not where its centroid sits — those overlap.

  // on a noise source the peak wanders 84% between renders, and three checks in this file
  // went flaky before I stopped using it.
  // AVERAGING, sized against measured variance rather than picked. Per render: /ʃ/ high-share
  // is 40.4% ±12.1% and /ð/ 31.0% ±13.4%, so at three renders the two distributions overlap
  // often enough to trip the 0.95 margin about 2% of the time — and it did, once in seven runs
  // while checking something unrelated. A gate that fails at random is worse than one that
  // fails, because the next green tick means nothing. Averaged over longer renders with more
  // spectral hops, which buys the same variance reduction far cheaper than more renders do.
  //
  // NOTE, and it wants looking at: the LEVEL half of this test is currently vacuous. /ð/
  // measures 0.0202 against /ʃ/'s 0.0173 — the dental is LOUDER than the sibilant, so
