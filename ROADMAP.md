# Roadmap — chasing the GOOOOAAALLL

**The goal:** a synthesized stadium goal cry, produced entirely by physical modelling, that a
room full of people would accept as a human being shouting.

**Where we are:** the tract produces recognisable vowels — nine of the eleven English
monophthongs land within 6% of Peterson & Barney's measured formants — and the /g/ is a real
seal-and-release. But the word currently comes out, in the project's own field notes, as
*"Goooo aaaa uuuwwll."* The vowels are there. The consonants and the vocal effort are not.

---

## Where it stands

| | |
|---|---|
| **Sounds** | 39 — 12 vowels, 5 diphthongs, 22 consonants |
| **Voices** | 9 presets plus Custom, two of them measured from a real speaker |
| **Voice vector** | 18 parameters, **36-character seeds**, carrying source, timing, tract length and fold model |
| **Gate** | 22 checks, `node lab/check.js` — subsettable, streaming, parallel |
| **Engine** | one copy, `engine/tract-worklet.js`, loaded by URL and read by the harness |
| **Phonemes** | one copy, `engine/phonemes.js` — shared by the app, the bench and the gate |
| **Bench** | `lab/bench.html` — sweep, blind test, minimal pairs, render-all-to-WAV |
| **Live** | johnhenryburns.github.io/hollerbox |

### Vowels are solved. Consonants are the work.

Vowels land within 12% of target: **10/10 against Peterson & Barney's measured adult-male
means**, plus schwa and /o/, which P&B did not measure, against conventional values. A labelled
ɑCɑ sweep on voice=john scored
**1 / 22** on consonants. That is four root causes, not twenty-two:

| # | fault | state |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No VOT — p/t/k heard as their voiced partners | ✅ fixed in `ee87eea` |
| 2 | Velar bursts fronting: g→d, k→t | ✅ fixed in `ee87eea` |
| 3 | Every fricative reads as undifferentiated hiss although the centroids are right (/s/ 4700 Hz, /ʃ/ 3000). Likely **level** — /s/ peaks around 3× the vowels | open |
| 4 | The nasal side branch is ~1.6 cm where a real nasal tract is 10–12, so there is no antiformant. /m n ŋ/ collapse to a generic voiced continuant and drag /z ð l r j w/ with them | open — biggest job, do it last and alone |

**Re-swept against `ee87eea`**, ɑCɑ, voice=john, 16 renders averaged:

*Voicing (VOT, ms).* Voiced stops unmoved at 10–15; voiceless were bunched at ~43 ms, inside
the voiced band, which is exactly why they were heard as /b d g/. They now sit at **75 / 80 /
105** for p/t/k, and in the right order — labial < alveolar < velar — so VOT now carries place
as well as voicing.

*Place (burst peak, Hz).* Before, all three voiceless bursts pinned to the bottom of the scan:
one dark thump, place erased. After: /p/ diffuse and low, **/t/ 4400**, **/k/ 2000**. The three
places separate.

Both fixes hold. What has *not* been done is the blind re-listen in `bench.html` — the ear is
still the judge, and the sweep score has not been re-taken.

*(An instrument note, because this project keeps being misled by its own: the first burst
measurement read 400 Hz for every stop on both builds. That was F0 and the voice bar swamping
the window, not a burst. Measure burst place above 800 Hz.)*

Built: the A/B tournament, the lateral branch, the articulatory layer, the LF source,
nasals, voiceless stops, fricatives, spelling-to-sound, the voice library, per-voice
articulation, source–tract interaction, and two-mass folds.

Not built: prosody beyond a pitch arc (Phase 4), finer sections (7c), and frequency-dependent
losses — which was attempted, measured, and reverted.

---

## The problem behind the problem

Every iteration so far has run on the same loop: change a parameter, render, listen, describe
the result as an animal, change another parameter. That loop produced nine versions of the
earlier formant synth and a document full of retracted findings. It is slow, and it burns the
one genuinely scarce resource in this project — a human ear that can tell whether something
sounds like a person.

The objective function lives in that ear. Nothing else can evaluate it. So the first job is not
to improve the cry; it is to **make evaluation cheap**.

That principle orders everything below.

---

## Why it sounds the way it does

A note from testing, which turned out to be the most useful framing anyone has offered:

> *"It sounds like the way deaf people who have learned to speak sound. Which is very close to
> the truth of how this is built."*

That is not a simile, it is a diagnosis. Speech learned without hearing tends to get
articulatory **targets** right — where the tongue goes is teachable — while timing, prosody,
nasal control and laryngeal quality drift, because those can only be tuned by hearing yourself
and correcting.

This synthesiser has precisely that profile. Formant targets are solved against measured data,
so place of articulation is correct. Timing is scripted uniformly. The pitch arc is invented.
There is no velopharyngeal control at all. The glottal source is a generic pulse with no model
of vocal effort.

The common cause is the same in both cases: **speech produced without auditory feedback.**

This changes what Phase 1 *is*. The A/B rig is not a convenience for tuning faster. It is the
missing feedback loop, with a human ear closing it — the one thing the model has never had.

---

## Phase 1 — the iteration rig

*Nothing else should start before this exists.*

### 1a. Offline sweep and scoring

A harness that renders hundreds of parameter combinations to audio and scores each one on the
things that have objective answers:

| measure | what it catches |
|---|---|
| formant trajectory vs target | is it saying the right vowels, at the right times |
| burst energy at release | is the /g/ actually a stop |
| spectral zero near F2 during /l/ | is the lateral real (Phase 2 gate) |
| AM depth in the 4–9 Hz band | the sheep. Never again |
| H1–H2 | pressed vs breathy phonation — vocal effort |
| spectral tilt | shout brightness without buzz |

This prunes the parameter space without a human hearing a single rendering. Anything that fails
these never reaches the ear.

### 1b. In-browser A/B tournament

Hear variant A. Hear variant B. Tap the better one. The app mutates around the winner and
serves the next pair. Eight to ten taps converges somewhere slider-dragging never would.

This is the correct tool when the judge is a human ear, and it puts every second of listening
time onto perceptual questions rather than measurable ones.

### 1c. Seed codes

Any cry can be saved, shared and returned to as a short string. Without this, a good result
found at 11pm on a phone is gone by morning.

**Done when:** a full tournament round — render, compare, choose, mutate — takes under a minute
on a phone, and a winner can be recovered exactly from its code.

---

## Phase 2 — the lateral branch  ✅ built

The /l/ is the largest intelligibility defect. It reads as a *w*.

A real lateral splits the airflow around the tongue and rejoins it, which places a **zero** in
the transfer function. A single unbranched tube is an all-pole system: it is not that our /l/
is badly tuned, it is that this geometry **cannot produce a lateral at all**.

The fix is a side-branch waveguide — a second short tube coupled at a junction, with its own
scattering. It is the same mechanism that produces nasals, so /m n ŋ/ come almost free
afterwards.

**Built.** Three-port scattering junction (pj = 2·Σu⁺/ΣA, u⁻ᵢ = Aᵢ·pj − u⁺ᵢ), verified to
reduce exactly to the two-port form when the branch is shut so it cannot disturb the validated
tract. The lateral was then re-solved *with* the pocket coupled: tongue-tip constriction at
u=0.74, a 12-section closed pocket tapping it. Measured in the shipping engine: a **−33.7 dB
notch at 1950 Hz**, and F2 lifted clear of /w/ territory. The same mechanism, with an open far
end at the velum, gives the nasals in Phase 5.

**Original criterion:** the spectrum during /l/ shows a measurable anti-resonance, and the F2 trajectory
stops rising into *w* territory at the end of the word.

---

## Phase 2b — the articulatory layer  ✅ built

The tract is currently parameterised abstractly: *a constriction somewhere, this wide, this
tight.* It reaches the vowels, but it does not know what a tongue is — which is how the solver
once handed back a lateral with **rounded lips**. Nothing in the model said lips and tongue are
different organs.

Replace that with six things a person actually has: **jaw, tongue body position, tongue body
height, tongue tip, lip aperture**, and later the velum.

**Feasibility, measured before committing:** an articulator model reaches **9 of 11 English
vowels within 10%** — the same accuracy as the abstract parameterisation. More tellingly, the
articulations it found are correct without being told any phonetics: /i/ came out high and
front, /ɑ/ low and back with an open jaw, /u/ with rounded lips, and schwa with the tongue at
rest and the jaw nearly closed. That is the vowel quadrilateral, recovered from tube acoustics.

**What it buys:**

- **Impossible solutions become impossible.** A tongue cannot be in two places, and lips are
  not part of it. The rounded-lip lateral could not have been proposed.
- **Six shared parameters instead of sixty-five.** Every phoneme currently carries five
  abstract numbers of its own. Articulators are shared, so the search space means something.
- **Coarticulation stops being interpolation.** A tongue has mass and cannot teleport;
  transitions become physical rather than linear blends between abstract shapes.
- **The picture becomes the point.** A mid-sagittal view — palate, tongue, jaw, lips — driving
  the area function that drives the tubes. You watch the tongue make the vowel.

**Done when:** every phoneme in the inventory is expressed as articulator positions, and the
mid-sagittal view and the tube view are two renderings of the same state.

### Does this break the rest of the plan?

No, and it helps three of the remaining phases:

| phase | interaction |
|---|---|
| **1 — tournament** | Untouched. The tournament tunes the *voice*; articulation belongs to the *word*. Seeds stay stable. |
| **2 — lateral branch** | Improved. The branch taps wherever the tongue tip is, instead of a hand-solved position — and the rounded-lip failure becomes unreachable. |
| **3 — LF source** | Orthogonal. The source sits upstream of the tract and does not care how the tube got its shape. |
| **4 — prosody** | Improved. Articulator mass gives transition timing a physical basis rather than a tuned constant. |
| **5 — rest of English** | Substantially helped. Nasals need a **velum**, which is an articulator. Fricatives need turbulence injected *at the constriction*, and an articulatory model knows where the constriction is by construction. |
| **library** | Improved. A word becomes a sequence of articulator targets — smaller, and portable across voices. |

The one real cost is a one-time re-solve of the whole phoneme inventory in articulator space,
plus a likely small accuracy loss on the rounded back vowels, which want finer lip modelling
than a single aperture parameter provides.

---

## Phase 3 — the shout source  ✅ built

The glottal source is currently a Rosenberg pulse. That is a model of **speech**.

A shout is not loud speech. It is *pressed phonation*: higher subglottal pressure, more abrupt
glottal closure, a different spectral slope, and more energy in the upper harmonics. Turning up
the gain on a speech source produces loud speech, which is why the cry still sounds like a
synthesizer rather than a person.

The replacement is the **LF model** (Fant, Liljencrants & Lin 1985), which parameterises the
derivative of glottal flow. Fant's later `Rd` collapses its shape onto a single knob sweeping
breathy → modal → pressed. One control, physically grounded, measurable through H1–H2.

This is the most likely single change to move the result from *instrument* to *person*.

**Built.** LF implemented with Fant's Rd mapping, eps and alpha solved by Newton iteration at
parameter-change time rather than per sample. Verified inside the shipping engine: H1-H2 runs
from **-5.3 dB at Rd 0.4 (pressed) to +12.8 dB at Rd 2.2 (breathy)**, matching published ranges.
Effort is linked: Rd falls toward the pressed end at the peak of a word, so a shout presses
rather than merely getting louder. Rd and press replaced the two Rosenberg knobs in the voice
vector, so seeds still load positionally.

**Original criterion:** H1–H2 sits in the pressed range at peak effort, and the source can sweep from
breathy to pressed without the tract changing.

---

## Phase 4 — prosody  ◐ partial

The shape of the shout over time: the onset, the climb, the sustained strain at the top, the
fall at the end. Roughly six parameters — pitch arc, effort arc, drawl distribution, final
descent, and the amount and rate of roughness.

All of these are perceptual. None of them should be guessed. They are exactly what the Phase 1
tournament is for.

**Done when:** the ear says so.

---

## Phase 5 — the rest of English  ✅ built

**5a built.** The nasal tract is a second branch — 11 cm, open at the nostrils — coupled by a
velum parameter. /m n ŋ/ are the /b d g/ closures with the velum open, and they measure as
proper murmurs (F1 330/380/415 Hz). One anatomical bug worth recording: the velopharyngeal port
was first placed at u=0.57, *downstream* of a velar closure, which sealed the nose off from the
glottis and left /ŋ/ completely silent. It has to sit upstream of the closure.

Voiceless stops are the same articulations with the folds apart: voicing gated to zero during
closure and a release about four times stronger, because a /k/ is aspirated where a /g/ is not.

The inventory is now **22 phonemes**, and *Maximus* is down to a single missing sound class.


Everything above serves one word. This phase makes the instrument general.

The current inventory is twelve vowels plus /l b d g/, which is enough for **goal, gold, ball,
bulldog, dad, good, bird** and any other word built from voiced stops and vowels. It is not
enough for most names. Taking "Maximus" — /m æ k s ɪ m ə s/ — as the worked example, three
things are missing, and they differ enormously in cost:

| missing | what it needs | cost |
|---|---|---|
| /m n ŋ/ nasals | side branch coupled at the velum | ✅ **built** |
| /p t k/ voiceless stops | existing closure, voicing gated off, aspiration on release | ✅ **built** |
| /s ʃ f θ/ fricatives | sustained turbulence at a constriction, plus the short front cavity that gives sibilants their resonance | ✅ **built** |

Note the ordering that falls out of this: **Phase 2 pays for the nasals as a side effect.** The
branched waveguide built to fix the /l/ is the same mechanism that opens the velopharyngeal
port. Voiceless stops are close to free once it exists — the tube already seals and releases;
what changes is that the glottis is quiet and the burst is aspirated rather than voiced.

Fricatives are the genuine addition. A noise source has to be injected *at* the constriction
rather than at the glottis, with its level driven by the pressure drop and the constriction
area, and sibilants need geometry fine enough to resolve the small cavity in front of the teeth
that puts /s/ up around 4–8 kHz. That may also force a higher section count.

**5b built.** Turbulence is generated at the constriction and injected *forward*, so only the
cavity in front of it shapes the result — which is the whole reason /s/ is high and /ʃ/ lower.
The /s/ articulation was solved for a narrow gap well forward (tip at u=0.91, gap 0.18) leaving
a 1.6 cm front cavity. Measured: peak in the sibilant range with 70% of energy above 3 kHz.
A **hiss** parameter joined the tournament.

**Done — the app says names it was never tuned for.** Inventory 26 phonemes.
*Maximus, Solana, Max* all render clean.

**Original criterion:** the app can say a name it was never tuned for.

---

## The voice library  ✅ built

**A voice is now one vector, and a seed is the whole voice.** Seventeen parameters covering
source (Rd, effort, jitter, breath), radiation, timing (seconds per sound, drawl, glide, stop
hold), the burst and hiss, the vowel opening, and **tract length in sections**. Thirty-four
characters. Every preset round-trips exactly, which means a tuned voice can be handed back as a
string and baked in as a default.

Current preset seeds. Paste one into the Lab to restore that voice exactly, or hand a tuned
one back to be baked in as a new default:

```
    Goal announcer  2aulgsqnawl6gpc67imbafci4ad9se26qq00
    John            fz6hc0qnawk41514192wafci4ad9om1t1j00
    John shouting   3issflqnawnab87g3xllafci4ad9om26qq00
    Man             aj6hc0qnawj22b2q272wafci4ad9ub1t3m00
    Woman           ft5ec0qnawm8hahmgw2wafci4ad9ls1t3m00
    Child           hk4bflqnawnar2rar82wafci4ad9g31t3300
    Helium          aj6hc0qnawj22b2q272wafci4ad94q1t3m00
    Whisper         z300llqnawri77777u3mafci4ad9se135500
    Barry White     7k7xd7wiawj200000051afci4ad9w73m5500
```

Presets ship as complete vectors; **Custom** is what you get the moment you touch a slider or
choose in the Lab, and it reveals the timing and tract-length editors. Everything else stays
hidden, because a preset that can be half-edited is a preset you cannot trust.

One caveat worth stating: **per-phoneme articulation is still global.** The tongue postures for
/o/ or /s/ are shared by every voice; only the tube length changes. Making postures per-voice —
so a child rounds differently from an announcer — is a further step, and probably the right one
eventually.

Voices are presets over source *and tract length*, because length is what makes a voice read as
a man, a woman or a child — pitch alone does not. Measured on /ɑ/: 17.5 cm gives 680/1070,
14.7 cm gives 815/1280, 12.3 cm gives 980/1535. Those ratios are exactly the length ratios, and
they land on published adult-female and child data.

Helium is the same knob by another route, and the best demonstration in the app: the gas carries
sound faster, so the same source at the same pitch rings an acoustically much shorter tube.
Source and filter come apart audibly.

Shipping: **Goal announcer, Man, Woman, Child, Helium, Whisper.** Any voice can say any word.

---

## Phase 6 — words from spelling  ✅ built

Typing *Maximus* and having it work, instead of tapping out `m æ k s ɪ m ə s`.

**The catch is ordering.** Grapheme-to-phoneme is only useful once Phase 5 exists. Today the
inventory is twelve vowels and four consonants, so a converter would spend most of its time
reporting phonemes the model cannot pronounce. It belongs after the rest of English, not before.

**The approach**, in increasing cost:

1. **A hand-written dictionary.** For a family project this is not a compromise, it is the
   right answer for the words that matter most. Names are exactly where automatic conversion is
   worst, and there are perhaps thirty that count.
2. **Letter-to-sound rules.** The NRL rule set (Elovitz, Johnson, McHugh & Shore, 1976, NRL
   Report 7948) is the classic: 329 rules, and the report claims correct pronunciations for
   about **90%** of words in average text. Later independent evaluations put practical accuracy
   lower, and names are much worse than either figure. *(Corrected: this used to say the rules
   are "still used in eSpeak" and cite 70–85%. eSpeak ships its own per-language rule files and
   no source connects it to the NRL set, and 70–85% was not the report's own number.)*
3. **Rules plus an exception list**, which is what practical systems actually ship. The
   exception list is the dictionary from (1), and it grows every time someone corrects it.

**The feature that makes it work regardless of accuracy:** show the phonemes it chose, let them
be edited by tapping, and remember the correction. Then a wrong guess costs one tap and is wrong
only once. Given that the words we care about are family names, the personal dictionary will
outperform any general converter within a week of use.

**Usable before Phase 5:** the same machinery answers *"can this word be said yet?"* — which
turns the missing-phoneme list into something concrete rather than abstract.

**Built.** Rules first (digraphs, magic-e, soft c and g, common endings), then a personal
dictionary in local storage that overrides them. Five approximants — /w j r h v/ — were added
to make English spelling reachable; they are vowel postures with no closure, so they cost
nothing. Every test word came out sayable, with the expected failures on names: *solana* rules
to `s ɑ l æ n æ` rather than `s o l ɑ n ə`. Correcting it takes one tap and holds.

**Done — a name can be typed, corrected once if needed, and spoken thereafter.**

---

## The calibration library

A/B tournaments should not produce one good goal cry. They should produce a **voice**.

The parameters divide cleanly, and this division is what makes a library possible:

- **A voice** is the source and expression: glottal shape, effort arc, pitch range, roughness,
  brightness. It is completely word-independent. *"Stadium shout", "announcer", "small child",
  "grandfather".*
- **A word** is a phoneme sequence and its timing. It is completely voice-independent.
  *goal, bulldog, Maximus.*

They compose. Any voice can say any word. A tournament tunes a **voice**, and every word in the
library immediately inherits the result — so the listening effort spent perfecting the goal cry
is not spent again on the next word.

That means the seed code from Phase 1c should encode the pair — `voice:word` — and the library
is simply two lists that multiply.

The near-term consequence: tune the stadium-shout voice on *goal*, because it is short and we
know what it should sound like. Then point it at *bulldog*, and later at the kids' names, and
the hard-won calibration comes along for free.

---

## Which parameters go where

The split matters, because it decides what costs human attention:

**Machine decides** (objective, swept and scored offline): vowel target geometry, formant
accuracy, burst timing and strength, lateral branch dimensions, anti-alias and stability
margins, sheep-band suppression.

**Human decides** (perceptual, settled by tournament): drawl distribution, pitch arc shape,
effort arc, roughness amount, brightness, how the word ends.

Roughly 20 parameters total, of which only 6–8 should ever reach a human.

---

## Success criteria

The ear is final. But these gates must pass on the way, or the ear is being asked to judge
something already known to be broken:

1. Lateral shows an anti-resonance
2. Formant trajectory tracks a real /gɔːl/ within tolerance
3. H1–H2 in the pressed range at peak effort
4. No AM above ~2% in the 4–9 Hz band
5. Spectral tilt in voice range, not buzz range
6. A tuned voice can speak a word it was never tuned on, without retuning

---

## Open questions

- **Does a stadium cry even want to be intelligible?** Real ones are half-articulated. Perhaps
  the target is not a clean /gɔːl/ but a controlled collapse of one.
- **Does nasal coupling help?** Shouting often leaks through the velopharyngeal port. Once the
  branch exists in Phase 2, this is a cheap experiment.
- **How much roughness is right?** Real shouting is slightly chaotic. Every attempt so far to
  add irregularity by hand has made it *less* human. Emergent roughness — from a two-mass fold
  model — may be the only honest route, but that is a Phase 5 question.

---

## Per-voice articulation  ✅ built

Postures were **global**: every voice moved its tongue identically and only the tube length
changed. That cannot represent a real speaker. The measured /u/ and /ʊ/ in the reference
recording are *fronted* by around 400 Hz in F2 — a dialect feature, not a tract-length one,
and shared postures have no way to express it.

A voice may now carry its own postures and fall back to the shared ones for anything it does
not override. Fitted against the recording: **mean vowel error 21% with generic postures, 4%
with measured ones.**

**Consonants are still hand-placed**, from articulatory description — "tip to the ridge",
"body to the velum" — then adjusted until the acoustics looked right. They are not fitted to
anyone. That is the next honest gap.

### The estimator that invented a formant

The first fit reported every vowel within 0.5–4%. The postures it produced were wrong. It had
optimised against **LPC**, which for two of the vowels placed F2 around 2500 Hz where the
transfer function has no peak at all — /ɛ/ came out 1620 Hz adrift. Plotting the spectrum
settled it in one look: peaks at 500, 900 and 2950, and nothing between.

Sixth time in this project that a measurement, rather than a piece of reasoning, has been the
thing that was wrong. The rule that keeps holding: **peak-pick the transfer function; do not
trust LPC**, and when two estimators disagree, plot the thing.

---

## Consonants, measured

Consonant postures were the last part of the model with no evidence behind them — described
rather than measured, then adjusted until the acoustics looked plausible. The reference
recording covers all of them, so they were extracted by acoustic signature rather than by
position: a fricative is the frame with the most high-frequency energy relative to low, a
nasal murmur is the frame with the lowest first formant.

**Approximants and nasals fitted cleanly** — /r/ to 1%, /ŋ/ to 0%, /n/ and /j/ and /l/ to 4%.
The measured nasals have first formants at 234–307 Hz where the model had 330–415; a real
murmur is lower than I had it.

**Fricatives took four attempts and a reversal.** The measurements said the whole family was
far too bright: /ʃ/ at 4250 Hz against a real 2188, /f/ at 6050 against 2438, /θ/ at 9800
against 1750. Three structural fixes followed, each from the same observation — that a
sibilant has a front cavity and an obstacle to strike, and a labiodental or dental has
neither:

- the low cut has to **track the sound**, because a fixed 2.8 kHz corner cannot produce a
  fricative that peaks at 2.2 kHz — it removes exactly the band that sound lives in;
- a fricative is **broadband noise with a resonance on top**, not a resonator fed by noise,
  which is why /ʃ/ had no high tail;
- and **no cavity means no resonance claim** — three sections is not a resonator and should
  not be allowed a 7 kHz quarter-wave.

The reversal: I also tilted the source down for cavity-less fricatives, reasoning that slow
channel turbulence must be low-frequency. The recording disagreed — /f/ carries 65% of its
energy above 3 kHz and /ð/ 63%. They are not low, they are **broad**: a low peak with a long
tail. Removed.

Hand-tuning oscillated between 18 and 28 points of error; a systematic fit with **averaged**
measurements reached 6 on the sibilants and 16 on the rest. Averaging matters because a single
render of a noise source varies by a third, so tuning against one measurement is tuning
against the noise.

**Scope.** The first fricative fits were made at the reference speaker's tract length and did
not transfer — installing them globally broke sibilants at other lengths, because a fricative's
peak is set by the cavity in front of the constriction and that cavity scales with the tube.

So the generic inventory was refitted **at its own default length**, against the same recording
with the targets scaled by the tract ratio (peaks scale inversely with length; the
high-frequency *share* is a shape property and carries across unchanged). Mean error in
high-frequency share: **34 points hand-placed, 9 points fitted**, with every level landing in a
sensible band.

Two things made the fit work that did not work by hand. **Seeding from the target geometry** —
`front cavity = c/4f` fixes where the constriction has to sit, and a hill-climb started from
wherever the posture happened to be fell into a 400 Hz minimum for /ʃ/. And **averaging the
measurements**, because one render of a noise source varies by a third.

The last correction came from the recording again: with no front cavity the low-cut corner was
dropping very far and the lows swamped the sound — but a narrow aperture at the lips radiates
highs *better*, not worse, and a real /f/ carries 65% of its energy above 3 kHz.

---

## Phase 7 — pushing the physics

Measured against a real recording, the model is within 5–8 dB below 3 kHz and **10–17 dB
short above 5 kHz**. It is duller than the speaker. That deficit is the sound of missing
physics, and most of it can be named.

Ordered by expected payoff:

### 7a. Source–tract interaction  ✅ built

The glottis is not a fixed boundary. It is a hole whose area changes over every cycle — wide
open at peak flow, sealed at closure — so the reflection coefficient at that end should change
with it. Ours is a constant 0.75. Real folds are also *loaded* by the tract: the pressure wave
returning from above pushes back on them and skews the flow pulse. This is the difference
between a source that plays into a tube and a source that is part of one, and it is the most
likely single cause of the missing high end.

**Built.** The reflection now follows the glottal area, `r = (A1 − Ag)/(A1 + Ag)`: **0.99
when the folds seal, 0.88 at peak flow, 0.68 when they are abducted** for a voiceless sound.
Previously a flat 0.75 — the folds were not being loaded by the tract at all.

Two things fell out of building it. The first attempt derived glottal area from flow alone,
which made it *zero* during voiceless sounds — modelling abducted folds as sealed, the exact
opposite of the truth, and turning the glottis into a mirror. The gate caught it as a broken
sibilant at one tract length. The second is that abduction opens the glottis *wider* than the
phonatory cycle ever does, so the voiceless case needed its own value rather than a scaled one.

And a measurement worth keeping: the model's high-frequency deficit against a real recording
turned out to be **aspiration**, not losses or radiation. Every preset had breath set at
0.02–0.045; real modal phonation leaks considerably more, because the folds never seal
perfectly and there is always turbulence riding on the voice. Raising it closed most of a
10–17 dB gap above 5 kHz.

### 7b. Frequency-dependent losses  ❌ attempted, reverted

One damping constant is applied everywhere. Real losses are not flat: viscous and thermal
boundary-layer losses scale roughly with √f and with the inverse of the radius, and soft walls
absorb low frequencies through compliance. The audible consequence is **formant bandwidth** —
a real F1 is narrow and a real F3 is wide, where ours are all much the same. Flat bandwidths
are a large part of what makes synthetic speech sound like a filter bank.

**Measured first:** our bandwidths run 24–68 Hz with no trend from F1 to F3, against real
values of 50–90 for F1 and 110–180 for F3. So the diagnosis was right — a real F3 is two to
three times wider than a real F1, and ours were all alike.

**Two implementations, both reverted.**

*Per-section one-pole lowpass.* Gives exactly the right tilt — F3/F1 bandwidth ratio went from
0.7× to 1.9× — and loss that grows in narrow sections, which is physically correct. But
forty-four cascaded one-poles carry forty-four lots of group delay. That lengthens the tube:
F1 fell 11%, and every vowel drifted off its target.

*Consolidated at the boundary.* One filter per round trip instead of forty-four, which is
standard waveguide practice and mostly fixes the drift. But one filter is too gentle to reach
realistic bandwidths, and pushing it hard enough (wallK 0.82) brought the delay back —
vowel accuracy collapsed from 11/12 to 4/12, the uniform-tube validation shifted from
500/1500/2500 to 475/1430/2385, and stop releases went to 240% of the vowel.

**The trade, measured:** at the strongest setting that keeps 11 of 12 vowels, the bandwidth
ratio only reaches ~1.3×. The realism gained does not pay for the accuracy lost, so it is out.

**What it would take.** The obstacle is group delay, not the loss model. Doing this properly
means either a delay-compensated loss filter (shorten the delay lines by exactly the filter's
group delay, which varies with frequency and so needs an allpass to do honestly), or moving to
a formulation where losses are applied in a way that does not add delay at all. Both are real
work, and neither is a tuning exercise. Left documented rather than half-done.

### 7c. Finer sections

At 44.1 kHz with two scattering steps per sample the sections are 3.97 mm. A vowel resonance
spans dozens of them; the front cavity that gives /s/ its character spans **six**. Four steps
per sample halves the section length and roughly doubles the cost. This is the one that would
most improve fricatives.

### 7d. Two-mass folds  ✅ built

Replace the prescribed LF waveform with an oscillator: two coupled masses driven by
subglottal pressure. **Built, and selectable** — *Advanced → Vocal folds → oscillator*.

Three things fell out of the physics without being coded:

- **Pitch rises with tension** at an exponent of 0.44 against the spring law's 0.5. A mass on
  a spring, emerging.
- **Pitch also rises with breath pressure**, which is why a shout goes sharp.
- **Stiff folds at low pressure will not start at all.** That is phonation threshold pressure,
  a real and well-documented phenomenon, and nothing in the model mentions it.

**Two failures worth recording.** The first version never oscillated: with the folds held
*apart* at rest, the Bernoulli pressures on the two masses cancel and there is no net force —
it simply sat there. Real folds rest *adducted*, pressed together, so that subglottal pressure
has something to push against. And the second: a symmetric oscillator does **not** produce
jitter. It settles into a perfectly clean limit cycle, 0.00%. I had expected irregularity to
appear on its own and it does not.

**What it actually buys** is better than that. Real jitter comes from the *drive* — neural
firing is not perfectly regular and breath pressure wobbles. Feed the model a 10% wobble in
breath pressure and it returns **jitter 0.21% and shimmer 2.45%**, both in the healthy human
range, at a ratio of 11.8×. One input, correctly distributed across period, amplitude and
waveform shape. With a prescribed waveform you must set jitter and shimmer separately and
*choose* that ratio; here it is a consequence.

### What this will not achieve

It will not sound like a specific person. Sixty years of articulatory synthesis, up to and
including 3D MRI-derived models, has not managed that — while neural synthesis reached
human-indistinguishable a decade ago by learning a mapping and modelling nothing. The
achievable target here is *clearly intelligible, well-articulated speech that reads as a man
with roughly the right tract and pitch*. The value is that every part of it can be explained,
and you can watch it happen.

## Phase 8 — the suprasegmental layer  ◐ in progress

Phase 4 said prosody was "the shape of the shout over time" and left it at six parameters.
That framing was too small. What is actually missing is everything **above the phoneme**:
duration, stress, accent placement, amplitude envelope. Right now each of those is either a
constant or one global scalar.

Concretely, in `buildWord` every non-stop segment gets weight `1` (approximants `0.34`, the
first vowel `1+drawl*2.6`), every stop gets the same `stopHold`, every vowel gets the same
amplitude, and the F0 contour is one six-point template scaled to word length. The segmental
layer is good enough now that this is what remains audible.

**The diagnosis:** this is a well-built segmental synthesizer with no suprasegmental layer.

### Build order

The order is not the ranking by payoff — it is the ranking by payoff *given what each step
depends on*. 8.0 has no audible effect on its own and three later steps are blocked on it.

| | step | depends on | audible |
|---|---|---|---|
| **8.0** | syllabification and stress marking | — | no |
| **8.1** | duration weights | 8.0 | **large** |
| **8.1b** | make `D` a rate rather than an absolute length | 8.1 | medium |
| **8.2** | stop closure duration, unreleased finals | — | medium |  ✅
| **8.3** | per-segment amplitude | 8.0 | medium |  ✅
| **8.4** | F0: semitones, accent alignment, declination, perturbation | 8.0 | **large** |  ◐
| **8.5** | pause policy | — | medium |
| **8.6** | vowel reduction | 8.0 | medium |
| **8.7** | allophony: flapping, dark /l/, nasal assimilation | 8.0 | medium |
| **8.8** | layered jitter: drift and tremor | — | small |

### 8.0 Syllabification and stress  ✅ built

Maximum-onset syllabification over the phone string, then primary stress from a suffix and
prefix heuristic with a small exception list. Returned as a `stress` array **parallel to
`ph`**, alongside a `syl` breakdown — added to the return value rather than replacing it, so
every existing consumer of `{ph, from}` is untouched.

No sound changes. This step exists so that 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6 and 8.7 have something to read.

The heuristic is a heuristic and will be wrong: *banana* defaults to initial stress without
its entry in `STRESS_DICT`. A real system carries stress in the lexicon. Extending the
exception list is the cheap fix and the honest one.

### 8.1 Duration weights  ✅ built

The single largest missing cue, and it is a weight table — no DSP.

- **Voiced-coda lengthening.** The vowel in *bad* runs about 1.5× the vowel in *bat*. Verified
  absent: both spell to `b æ [d|t]` and `vw` hands the `æ` an identical share. This is the
  biggest allophonic duration cue in English.
- **Intrinsic length.** Tense `i u ɑ ɔ ɝ` and the diphthongs run 1.4–1.8× lax `ɪ ɛ æ ʌ ʊ`.
- **Final lengthening.** The phrase-final syllable stretches about 1.25×.
- **Polysyllabic shortening.** Syllables shorten as the word lengthens.
- **Stress.** Unstressed syllables run roughly half a stressed one.

Sources: Peterson & Lehiste (1960), JASA 32(6):693-703 for the intrinsic durations; House &
Fairbanks (1953) for the voiced-coda effect. Shipped with a gate check asserting *ratios*, which
survive a change of speaking rate where absolute milliseconds would pin the gate to one `per`.

Two things learned building it.

**The approximants had to be rescaled, not left alone.** Their flat 0.34 was calibrated when a
vowel weighed 1, and a vowel now weighs about 1.5. Left as it was, the /l/ of *goal* silently
lost a third of its length — 204 ms to 134 ms — as pure accounting. It is now held in ratio to
a reference vowel, and the gate watches that share. Whether /l/ *should* be longer or shorter is
a real question and belongs to 8.7, where dark /l/ lives; it is not something a timing step
should decide by accident.

**The VOT check turned out to have been flaky since it was written**, and 8.1 only exposed it.
See the entry under Open faults; the short version is that its voice-bar probe used a window one
pitch period long, so its reference was a coin flip. Fixed separately and first, with the bands
unmoved.

### 8.1b Make `D` a rate rather than an absolute length

The weights in 8.1 are normalised against their own sum and spent out of `pool`, so they
redistribute a word's duration without changing it. That means an isolated monosyllable cannot
lengthen: *bad* alone has one held segment, and one weight over itself is 1 whatever the weight
is. The effect is real and measured the moment there is something to be long relative to —
inside a polysyllable, or across a phrase — which is where the comparison lives in connected
speech anyway. But *bad* and *bat* spoken alone are still the same length, and they should not be.

The fix is to let the summed weights set the word's length and make `D` a rate. It is not hard;
it is *wide*. The F0 contour is built from `end`, the duration slider changes meaning, and every
gate band that measures a whole word moves. Its own branch.

### 8.2 Stop closure and unreleased finals  ✅ built

`stopHold` was one constant for all six. A voiced closure cannot be held — oral pressure rises
to meet subglottal and the folds stop — so it is short where a voiceless one is not: roughly
50–70 ms against 80–100. Now a multiple of `stopHold` rather than an absolute, so it tracks the
voice's own timing; at the default 75 ms that is 60 against 90. Word length is still exactly
`D`, the same invariant 8.1 holds, so nothing else in the gate moved.

**The claim that "every stop here gets a burst" was wrong, and I wrote it.** Measured before
changing anything: the /d/ of *bæd* releases at 0% of the vowel peak and the /g/ of *bʊldɔg* at
1%, against 184% for the medial /d/. Word-final stops were **already unreleased** — the tract
simply never reopens at word end, so no burst fires. That is the correct English behaviour, but
it was arrived at by accident and nothing was holding it in place. So the work here was not to
build it but to **pin it**, with a paired assertion: final stops silent, medial stop loud. The
medial half matters as much as the final one, since without it the check would still pass if
bursts stopped working altogether.

A side effect worth naming rather than taking credit for: because voiced closures are now
shorter, they leave more of `pool` for the vowel, so *bad* does come out with a slightly longer
vowel than *bat* even in isolation — 757 ms against 727. That is pool arithmetic, not the
coda-voicing rule of 8.1, and it is far short of the 1.5 that rule wants. 8.1b is still the
thing that fixes it properly.

Place of articulation also moves closure duration — labials longest, velars shortest — but the
effect is smaller, the literature less consistent, and nothing in the bench would catch it going
the wrong way. Not done rather than done badly.

### 8.3 Per-segment amplitude  ✅ built

This entry listed two things. **One of them was already done, by the tube.**

*Open vowels are 4–6 dB louder than close ones* — measured, before writing a line of 8.3:

    ɑ 0.0   ɪ -0.7   ɛ -1.0   æ -1.5   ʌ -2.1   o -2.9
    ɔ -3.6   ɝ -3.7   i -4.0   ʊ -4.1   u -5.6

A span of **5.6 dB**, with /ɑ/ loudest and /u/ quietest — the real ordering, in the real range.
Nothing in the code says so. A wide mouth radiates more efficiently than a rounded one, the lip
section carries that, and the intrinsic loudness of a vowel falls out of its shape. Adding the
per-vowel gain table this entry implied would have double-counted geometry the model already
has, in a project whose stated claim is that it contains no such tables. Pinned as a **report**
measurement instead, which is exactly what the report tier is for: it is worth watching and it
is not something to block on.

*Unstressed syllables are quieter* — that one was real. Nothing in the amplitude path had ever
been told which syllable carries the stress, and three syllables of *banana* measured within
0.9 dB of each other. Every keyframe now carries a level, 1 for stressed and 0.65 for not
(−3.7 dB, mid-range of the published 3–6). It rides beside `fr` and `as`, and it applies to the
frication as well as the voicing — an unstressed syllable is quieter because less air is moving,
and the same air makes the hiss, so voicing it alone would make an unstressed /s/ the loudest
thing in the word.

The two effects interact rather than adding, which is correct and worth expecting: *together*
spreads 8.5 dB because its stressed /ɛ/ is intrinsically loud, while *computer* spreads only 2.0
because its stressed /u/ is intrinsically the quietest vowel there is. Real speech does the same.

The default path is unchanged and gated as such: supply no stress — a chain tapped in by hand,
anything that never went through the speller — and every level stays 1.

### 8.4 F0  ◐ 0, 1, 2 and 3 built; 4 blocked

Four changes, smallest first:

0. **One copy first.**  ✅ The contour was built in FOUR places — `index.html` twice, the
   harness and the bench — as the same six lines copied out. That is the mistake this project
   already paid for once, when the harness kept its own near-copy of `buildWord` and the
   comment beside it admitted a gate with a slightly different copy is how you end up testing
   the wrong thing. `buildF0` in `phonemes.js`, and a structural gate assertion that no other
   file grows one back.
1. **Interpolate in semitones, not Hz.**  ✅ It was linear in Hz, so a fall from 200 to 100
   spent half its time above 150 where the ear puts the midpoint at 141. Every fall in every
   voice was the wrong SHAPE — too slow at the top, too fast at the bottom — while still
   hitting all the right endpoints, which is exactly why it never showed up as a wrong note.
   Gated by driving the real processor, since the engine does its own interpolation and that
   was the copy that mattered.
2. **Consonant perturbation.**  ✅ A vowel does not start at its own pitch: after a voiceless
   obstruent it starts high and falls in, after a voiced one it starts low and rises. Hombert,
   Ohala & Ewan (1979). Asymmetric — the voiceless raising is about twice the voiced lowering —
   and gone within ~60 ms, which is why it is microprosody rather than intonation.

   Defined and gated in **semitones, not hertz**: 1.9 st is 28 Hz on the default 250 Hz voice
   and 11 Hz on John's 95, and the published 10–25 Hz is quoted for male voices. In hertz the
   assertion would have been voice-dependent and the effect would have been wrong on half the
   presets. Depth is `pert` in `VOICE_SPEC`.

   This forced a rewrite of how the contour is assembled, and the rewrite is the useful part.
   Accents and perturbation both land on the same vowel — a stressed syllable after a /t/ has a
   raised onset *and* an accent peak, and really does have both — so pushing points onto the
   contour made them fight over the same instant. The contour is now a **baseline plus summed
   offsets in semitones**, sampled where anything changes. Semitones add where hertz would not,
   which is the other reason that is the right space to work in.

   Two bugs from that rewrite, both caught by the gate: the offsets were evaluated on strictly
   open intervals, so nothing was active *at* a ramp's start, which is exactly where
   perturbation lives — it fired on nothing. Closing both ends instead double-counts at an
   accent's peak, where one ramp ends and the next begins. Half-open, `[t0, t1)`.
3. **Accent alignment.**  ✅ Excursions now sit on the stressed syllables rather than at
   `end*0.55`. The old arch is kept as the BASELINE — it is a good goal cry, it was measured
   from one — and accents ride on top of it. They are **multiplicative**, because pitch is:
   three semitones is three semitones wherever the baseline happens to be, which is what stops
   a late accent vanishing into the declination. Only on the NUCLEUS: `stress` marks every
   phone of a stressed syllable, and accenting all of them puts three excursions on one
   syllable and reads as a wobble. Depth is `acc` in `VOICE_SPEC`, default 3 semitones, and
   `acc=0` returns the baseline exactly — gated, because every prosody knob is a bisection tool.

   **Known gap, from the first run:** the speller marks every monosyllable as stressed, so the
   article *a* in "banana and a tomato" takes an accent. Real phrases destress function words.
   That is phrase-level stress and it wants its own step; it is not an accent-placement bug.
4. **Declination and reset.**  ❌ **blocked, and worth naming why.** The baseline already falls
   across the utterance. What is missing is the *reset* at a phrase boundary — and a phrase
   boundary is punctuation, which the speller deletes: `replace(/[^a-z]/g,'')` on the way in.
   Nothing downstream can tell a comma from a space, so there is no boundary to reset at.

   The same missing information blocks the terminal contour, since a question and a statement
   differ by a mark that never arrives. Punctuation has to survive the speller first, and that
   pairs naturally with **8.5**, which also needs to know which boundaries are real.

The goal-cry template stays as a voice preset. It is a good shout; it is just not a sentence.

### 8.5 Pause policy

`isPause` emits `sil:1, vl:1` and a 90–300 ms gap at **every** space. Most word boundaries
inside a phrase carry no silence at all — only continuous articulation. Default the gap to
zero, keep the articulatory glide, and reserve real silence for punctuation. Until then a
phrase will keep sounding like a word list.

Note that check 15 — *a pause is silent, but the tract keeps moving* — asserts the current
behaviour. It will need rewriting to assert the movement without requiring the silence.

### 8.6 Vowel reduction

`WEAK_FIRST` catches prefixes; with 8.0 this becomes general. Reduce unstressed lax vowels in
non-final syllables to `ə`. Deliberately **not** bundled into 8.0: it changes what the speller
emits, check 9 watches the speller, and a step that both adds a channel and changes the
existing one cannot be bisected.

### 8.7 Allophony

Flapping first — `/t d/` to an alveolar tap between vowels when the second is unstressed. Both
*better* and *water* are already in the test vocabulary and both currently come out fully
articulated. Then dark versus light `/l/`: `ART` carries one `/l/`, and a coda `/l/` wants a
much lower `bodyPos`. Then nasal place assimilation.

### 8.8 Layered jitter

`jitT` is one random walk updated at 40 Hz through a one-pole. Real F0 perturbation is layered:
cycle-to-cycle jitter around 0.5%, a slow drift at 0.3–0.5 Hz and 1–2%, and tremor at 4–7 Hz.
Adding drift and tremor to the LF path is a few lines.

On the two-mass path the existing diagnosis holds — the oscillator is symmetric, so it settles
into a limit cycle cleaner than the LF path with jitter applied. The fix is left/right fold
asymmetry of a few percent in mass and stiffness, which produces jitter *through* the physics
rather than on top of it.

---

## The prosody knobs are in the voice  ✅ built

Everything 8.1 to 8.3 introduced was a module constant in `phonemes.js`, which meant the one
part of the model that most needs an ear could not be swept, could not be seeded, and could not
differ between voices. Phase 1's thesis is that the first job is making evaluation cheap; this
is that, applied to a layer which did not exist when Phase 1 was written.

Eight entries appended to `VOICE_SPEC`:

| | | default |
|---|---|---|
| `vlen` | how much intrinsic vowel length varies | 1 |
| `coda` | how strongly a coda lengthens the vowel | 1 |
| `wkdur` | unstressed syllable duration | 0.60 |
| `wklev` | unstressed syllable level | 0.65 |
| `fnl` | final lengthening | 1.25 |
| `poly` | shortening per extra syllable | 0.12 |
| `stopVc` | voiceless/voiced closure ratio | 1.5 |
| `apw` | approximant weight against a reference vowel | 0.34 |

**Scalars over the published tables, not the tables themselves.** Twelve vowel durations as
twelve knobs is a search space nobody can walk, and the question an ear asks is not "what should
/ɔ/ be" but "is the vowel-length effect too strong". So 1 means the measured values and 0 means
the effect is off — which makes each of these a **bisection tool** as well as a tuning knob:
turn one to 0 and that part of Phase 8 is gone, continuously, without touching code.

`stopVc` splits around a mean of 1 rather than scaling one side, so changing the ratio moves the
voiced/voiceless split without moving how much time stops take altogether. Otherwise it would
quietly have been a speaking-rate knob as well.

They arrive at `buildWord` as one `pros` object rather than eight arguments, so 8.4's knobs can
join without touching a call site again — and a voice *is* that object, since every key is in
`VOICE_SPEC`.

Appended rather than inserted, so every seed written before today still loads with the new knobs
at their published values. The seed is now 52 characters.

**Gated on the thing that matters:** passing the defaults is bit-identical to passing nothing.
This exposed the constants, it did not retune them, and if that ever stops being true then every
band tuned before today was tuned against something else. Exact rather than tolerant — the
scaling form was chosen so that unity is exact in floating point, which was checked before it
was relied on.

### When to sweep

Not yet. Perceived stress is carried jointly by duration, level and pitch, and pitch currently
contributes nothing — `eff` is a fixed arch across the utterance that ignores stress entirely.
Dial `wkdur` and `wklev` by ear now and they will be over-dialled, because the ear compensates
for the missing third cue; then 8.4 lands and everything is too much, with no way to tell which
of the three is wrong. Sweep after **8.4's accent-alignment step** specifically — semitone
interpolation and consonant perturbation do not create the confound, accent alignment does.

Note that eight more knobs is a much larger space than the tournament was built for. Fix most,
vary two or three.

---

## What the ear said

A listening pass over the twelve bench phrases, John's voice, defaults. Recorded because the
notes decompose into far fewer causes than complaints, and because "it sounds robotic" is not
actionable until you know which eight phrases said it.

**"Robotic", on eight of twelve.** The dominant note by a wide margin. Two known causes, both
unbuilt: pitch contributes *nothing* to stress — `eff` is a fixed arch across the utterance —
and every articulator comes to a dead stop at every keyframe, because `u*u*(3-2u)` has zero
derivative at both ends. That is 8.4 and Phase 9, in that order, which is where they already sat.

**"payter peeper", "lah-zee".**  ✅ fixed — a list, not a rule. See Open faults.

**The lateral is an approximant, and it should be a contact.**  See below; this turned out to be
the most interesting thing in the notes.

**Pops at word boundaries**, reported in three phrases. Measured: the loudest transient in each
is only 3-4× the signal's own motion, where a stop burst is 174%. So these are *not* broadband
clicks and the existing click check is right not to fire. The lead is that `vl` and `sil` are
**step functions** — `this.voiceless=(u<0.5?a.vl:b.vl)` flips at the keyframe midpoint rather
than interpolating, and `if(this.silNow) flow=0` is a hard gate. `vAmp` smooths at about 5.7 ms,
which is fast enough to be heard as a click. That would put pops exactly where they were
reported: word boundaries, and either side of /f/ and /s/. Cheap to test, not yet tested.

**/dʒ/ heard as a noisy "sh"**, twice. It is spelled `d`+`ʒ` and nothing binds a stop release to
a following fricative, so no affricate ever forms — two separate sounds in a row.

**/h/ too quiet and the final /oʊ/ of "hello" does not trail off**, twice.

**"world" as "murd", "brown" unintelligible.** Both are liquid clusters. Same family as the
lateral finding, probably the same cause.

**"the m of *mother* is lost, the m of *my* is fine."** Word-initial nasal after a vowel across a
boundary. Suspected to be the same pause handling as the pops — 8.5.

---

## The lateral has no contact  ❌ not started

Observed by ear, from outside the project: *when a person says /l/ their tongue flicks against
the teeth.* It does, and the model has no such thing. Measured, narrowest diameter in the tract:

| | min diameter | position |
|---|---|---|
| /d/ /t/ /n/ | **0.020 — sealed** | 81% of the way to the lips |
| **/l/** | **0.477** | 84% |
| /w/ | 0.430 | 95% |

**The model's /l/ is less constricted than its /w/.** A real /l/ is a *complete* midline closure
at the alveolar ridge — the same place /d/, /t/ and /n/ seal — with the sides of the tongue
lowered so the air escapes laterally. Here the midline stays open at approximant width and the
side branch is a decoration on top of it rather than the only path the air has.

That single fact explains a lot at once. It is why the lateral "slurs"; it is why *world* comes
out as *murd* when its /l/ is wider than its /w/; and it is why there is no flick, because there
is no contact to break. The check that says "the lateral is not a /w/" passes on the static
transfer function with the branch open, and is measuring the branch rather than the articulation.

**What the fix has to be.** The topology, not the numbers. Today's branches are dead-end pockets
that tap in and reflect — right for the pocket that gives /l/ its zero, wrong for the channel
that carries the flow. A lateral wants the main tube SEALED at the tip and a **shunt** that
leaves the tube before the seal and rejoins it after: a branch with two junctions rather than
one. The closed pocket stays, for the zero. Then the release is a genuine seal-and-break, which
is the flick, and it comes free from the same machinery the stops already use.

This also gives dark /l/ somewhere to live (8.7): light and dark differ in the tongue *body*
while both make the same tip contact, which is not expressible while the tip is an approximant.

Not small. It is the first branch topology change since the nasal tract, and the gate band for
the lateral will move because the thing being measured will have changed. Its own branch.

---

## Phase 9 — interpolate in articulatory space  ❌ not started

`buildWord` already emits an `art` array of six-parameter postures alongside the 44-element
diameter arrays. The worklet interpolates the **diameter arrays**: 44 correlated numbers, when
the six latent ones are sitting right there unused.

Moving the interpolation into articulatory space buys three things at once:

- **Per-articulator time constants.** Lips and jaw are slow (~8–10 Hz), the tongue tip is fast
  (~15 Hz), the tongue body slowest. One global `glide` for all of them is exactly why `/l/`
  needs the `glide*0.45` special case in `glideFor` — that special case is a symptom, and it
  should disappear on its own when this lands. That is the test.
- **Undershoot, for free.** Drive each parameter toward its target with a critically damped
  second-order filter instead of interpolating to it, and short segments stop arriving. Failing
  to reach the target is most of the difference between connected speech and concatenated
  postures. Every segment currently arrives exactly.
- **Velocity continuity.** `u*u*(3-2u)` has zero derivative at both ends, so all six
  articulators come to a dead stop at every keyframe and start again. Real articulators pass
  *through* targets. Suspected to be part of what reads as over-enunciation.

It also removes the three O(n) per-sample passes the lab README measures as 95% of gate cost:
six parameters at control rate instead of 44 diameters at 44.1 kHz. **But** that README also
records that moving articulation to control rate cost 1.7 dB of spectral movement and would
force a band recalibration. So this is a recalibration-sized change and wants its own branch —
which is the reason it sits behind Phase 8 rather than in front of it, despite being the more
interesting piece of work.

## The voice was too clean

Reported as *"unnatural peaks in the spectrogram"* and *"still robotic"*. Checking the output
against the tract's transfer function found no spurious resonances at all — every peak was a
harmonic, exactly where it should be. The problem was not wrong peaks. It was peaks that were
**too distinct**.

**Harmonic-to-noise ratio** measures this: how much energy sits *on* the harmonics against
*between* them. A perfectly periodic source puts everything on the harmonics and nothing in the
gaps, which is the comb-like appearance of synthesis and much of what makes it sound like a
machine. Real voices leak — the folds never seal perfectly, and there is always turbulence
riding on the voice.

Measured: **the model at 38 dB.** Published healthy voices sit around 15–25 — Praat's own
documentation puts a healthy sustained [a] near 20, and the clinical literature runs roughly
7–26. Thirty-eight is not a person.

*Corrected 2026-07: this section used to report the reference recording at 2–5 dB on the same
measure. That is the hoarse/pathological range, not a healthy one, and it was almost certainly
our estimator misreading a room recording. Nothing was calibrated against it — the band is
v < 30, from the published range — and the presets landed at 12–29 dB, inside the human band.
The number was wrong; the work it prompted was not.*

The fix is aspiration, and the parameter could not even reach it — `brth` was capped at 0.12
when about 0.20 was needed. Widened, and every preset raised. All nine now sit between 12 and
29 dB, inside the human band, with a check to keep them there.

Worth noting what this was *not*: not the formant bandwidths, not a bug in the tract, not the
new oscillator. Just a source that was cleaner than any real larynx.

## On flaky checks

Twice now a check has passed and failed at random, and both times the cause was the same:
**measuring a noise source once**. Frication is intermittent by design — the jet sheds eddies —
so a single render of /ʃ/ can report anywhere from 42% to 77% of its energy above 3 kHz. A
threshold anywhere in that range is a coin flip.

The second time it slipped through and deployed, because the gate's own run happened to pass
while a verification run failed. A flaky gate is worse than a failing one: it launders a
problem into a green tick.

The rule: **any check measuring a random process averages, over windows long enough to see
several cycles of whatever makes it random.** Five consecutive runs must agree before it counts
as stable.

**The root cause is now gone, and the rule still stands.** The harness seeds `Math.random` and
reseeds before every render, so a render is a pure function of its arguments — bit-identical
across runs and across job scheduling. Nothing in the gate can be a coin flip any more.

Two things that does NOT excuse. A check can still pass on one seed and fail on another, so
`HOLLER_SEEDS=k` re-runs everything across k seeds and requires agreement; that is the "five
consecutive runs" rule, made cheap. And a short window still measures the wrong thing whether or
not it is reproducible — the VOT probe below was measuring one pitch period, and seeding it
would only have made it reliably wrong. Determinism buys repeatability, not correctness.

## The harness

`node lab/check.js` — one command, one verdict, exit 0 means shippable. It drives the
**shipping engine**, extracted straight out of index.html, so it cannot drift from what
actually runs. Eleven checks, each with a band that exists because something once broke that
way: the uniform tube still resonating at c/4L, vowels against Peterson & Barney, stops sealing
at their own place of articulation, the lateral not collapsing into a /w/, nasals producing a
murmur, sibilants shaped rather than broadband, no clicks at releases, silence after a word
ends, every non-stop sound audible, output finite and unclipped, and Rd spanning the phonation
range.

Two rules learned the hard way. **Bands are calibrated against a known-bad build, not guessed** —
the click threshold sits at 220% because a deliberately over-driven burst measures 558% while
the shipping build measures 177%, and an earlier guess of 140% was flagging normal /d/
dynamics. And **the check must exit non-zero**: a gate that prints a failure but lets the
pipeline continue is not a gate, and one did exactly that here.

The harness found a real physics bug on its first run: the voice-bar decay was being applied to
nasals. That decay models pressure building behind a closure, but a nasal's closure has the
nose open, so pressure never builds — which is precisely why /m/ can be held forever and /b/
cannot. It was silencing /n/ and /ŋ/.

**On resolution.** The acoustic timestep is not a free parameter: section length = c × timestep,
so halving the step halves the section. At 44.1 kHz with two scattering steps per sample the
sections are 3.97 mm and articulation is recomputed every sample. For vowels that is ample — a
resonance spans dozens of sections. Where it bites is **sibilants**: the front cavity that gives
/s/ its character is only six sections long, so its resonance is quantised coarsely. Doubling to
four steps per sample would halve the sections and roughly double the CPU. That is the honest
case for finer resolution, and it is about fricatives, not about the model being under-sampled.

## Measured against a real voice

A recording of the whole phoneme set, 41 items, was analysed and fitted. Three findings, one
of which overturned a modelling decision.

**Tract length must come from F3.** Fitting length to F1 and F2 gave a flat, meaningless
minimum — everything from 40 to 52 sections landed within 1% — because those formants are
dominated by where the tongue is, so the search simply stretched the tube to cover for the
articulation model's limits. F3 barely moves with articulation; it tracks the tube. It gave
15.9 cm cleanly.

**/u/ and /ʊ/ sit ~400 Hz higher in F2 than Peterson & Barney.** That is not error, it is
*/u/-fronting* — a documented shift in modern American English, strongest in the West. The
1952 data was recorded from speakers born around 1900. Targets drawn from published averages
carry a seventy-year-old dialect.

**The goal cry does not open, and I had it backwards.** I had modelled a shouted vowel as
opening — the jaw dropping as it is held, turning a long /o/ into "goooaaa". Measured on a
real cry: F1 fell 35 Hz and F2 fell 73 Hz across 2.9 seconds. The vowel *closes* slightly and
sits backer and more rounded than any vowel in the speaker's own set. The pitch also falls
monotonically, 158 to 93 Hz, where the model had it rise then fall. Three assumptions, all
reasonable, all wrong, and none of them findable without a recording.

That is the argument for measuring rather than reasoning, stated as plainly as this project
can state it.

## Open faults

Things known to be wrong, so they are not rediscovered as surprises.

**The voice sounds hoarse, and the noise LEVEL is not why.**  ◐ fix shipped, then reverted Noticed by ear, and it survives
the obvious explanation. Harmonic-to-noise sits at 22.8 dB and every preset is between 12 and
29, which is inside the healthy human band — Praat puts a healthy sustained [a] near 20. So
there is not too much noise. What is wrong is its **colour**. Measured spectral tilt from
4–20 kHz, where real speech falls:

| | measured tilt | real speech |
|---|---|---|
| /ɑ/ | **+4.4 dB/oct** | −12 or steeper |
| /ʃ/ | +7.0 | falls above ~4 kHz |
| /ð/ | +10.8 | falls |
| /h/ | **−5.7** | −6 to −12 ✓ |

Everything rises toward Nyquist except /h/, and a vowel cannot do that. The cluster around
+4 to +7 dB/octave is the signature of a **differentiator**, which is exactly what lip
radiation is (R(z) = 1 − 1/z, +6 dB/oct) — correct physics that requires the source to roll off
to compensate. The breath noise mixed into the glottal source does not roll off. It goes in as
raw white noise:

    let src=(g*0.9 + (Math.random()*2-1)*this.breath*g)*this.vAmp;   // engine, unfiltered

The /h/ path and the stop-aspiration path both put their noise through a two-pole lowpass
first, and /h/ is the one sound on the list with a physically sane tilt. The filtered paths
behave; the unfiltered one does not.

This is one candidate cause for three separate complaints: the hoarseness, the `static` tag the
bench put on six sounds (g z ʃ ð v h), and the /ʃ ʒ h/ that read as hiss at levels where /f/
reads correctly — gain was measured and is not their problem. **The fix was made, shipped as `b1671ae`, and reverted as `ea9a62d`.** It ran the breath noise
through the same two-pole lowpass the other paths use, with the gain compensated by 5.139 — the
reciprocal of the 0.1946 of unit-variance white the filter passes. It broke the bench and made
*goal* render as static with gaps, and it was reverted whole to get back to a known-good build
before diagnosing. So the analysis above still stands and the remedy is still believed correct;
what is not yet known is why *that implementation* of it failed.

**The hypothesis recorded with the revert does not survive reading the code.** It said the new
filter carried per-sample state (`bh1`, `bh`) never reset at word end or sequence restart,
"where every other noise path in the engine is reset at those points". Only one of the three
is. `stopSeq` and the end-of-sequence branch reset `fh1 fh2 fhx fhy` — the frication path — and
nothing else. The /h/ path (`ah1`, `ah`) and the VOT aspiration path (`vh1`, `vh`) carry state
across words exactly as `bh` would have, and neither produces this symptom. That weakens the
hypothesis considerably. It is the fifth time in this project a confident diagnosis has not held
up, which is the reason this file records them.

**A better candidate, measured.** The 5.139 was derived to restore *variance*, and it does:

| | RMS | peak | crest | samples over \|1\| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| raw white | 0.577 | 1.000 | 1.73 | 0% by construction |
| two-pole, ×5.139 | 0.577 | **2.657** | **4.61** | **8.3%** |

Four million samples each. Variance is not peak. Lowpassing decorrelates nothing and *correlates*
everything — the result is a slower signal, and scaling it back to the same RMS gives it 2.66×
the excursion. The unfiltered term could never leave ±1; the filtered one leaves it 8% of the
time. That product goes into `src` alongside `g*0.9` and the output is hard-clipped at
`Math.max(-1,Math.min(1,yy*0.8))`. Clipping on the loud parts is a good description of "static",
and clipping hard enough to flatten a waveform is a good description of "gaps".

**Cheap test before re-attempting:** keep the filter, but normalise to peak rather than to RMS —
or simply divide the 5.139 by the measured crest ratio — and listen. If the static goes, the
gain derivation was the fault and not the filtering, and the spectral-tilt fix can be had at a
slightly lower noise level. Check the harmonic-to-noise band after either way, since that band
was calibrated against the level, not the colour.

**The dental fricatives hiss.** /ð/ in *mother* and *father* comes out as a staticy "sh"
rather than a soft voiced buzz. The measured target is a peak near 500 Hz with the energy
spread; the model puts it higher and noisier. Suspected cause: the aspiration raised across all
voices to fix the harmonic-to-noise problem also lands on the dentals, where there is very
little voicing to mask it. Not yet diagnosed properly.

**`WEAK_FIRST` reduces vowels it should not.** Found while smoke-testing 8.0. The prefix
regex only requires three more letters after the prefix, so it fires on *better* (be+tter),
*belly*, *reddish*, *apple*, *actor* and *angry*, and each of those spells with a schwa where
it should have a full vowel — *better* is `b·ə·t·ɝ` today. The regularity it is missing is
that an unstressed first syllable is **open**: the prefix is followed by a consonant and then
a vowel (a-bout, be-cause, to-gether), whereas two consonants close the syllable and stress it
(at-las, bet-ter, ap-ple). One lookahead, `(?=[^aeiouy][aeiouy])`, fixes all six — it is
already written and in use, as `WEAK_STRESS`, on the stress side where it changes no sounds.
Applying it to `WEAK_FIRST` changes what the speller emits, so it belongs with **8.6**, not in
a step that promises to change nothing. Note the Latin prefixes satisfy the lookahead
unchanged, since they already end in a consonant.

**The VOT check was measuring one pitch period.**  ✅ fixed, kept for the record. Its voice-bar
probe used a 512-sample window — 11.6 ms at 44.1 kHz, about ONE period of John's 95 Hz voice —
so it measured where the glottal pulse fell inside the window rather than how much voice bar
there was. Across a single steady vowel it returns 4.9 to 31, a 6× swing. `ref` was one sample
of that, so the check passed or failed on where the vowel's midpoint happened to land, and it
had done since it was written. Phase 8.1 moved the midpoint 14 ms and it landed on a peak.

The rule in *On flaky checks* covers it exactly, and this is the third time it has been needed —
the first where the random process was not a noise source but the pulse train. Measured ripple
by window length: 512 → 6.2×, 1024 → 1.29×, 1536 → 1.05×, 2048 → 1.05×, 3072 → 1.25× (it rises
again as the window outgrows the steady part of the vowel). Now 1536, and `ref` is the median
over the vowel rather than one instant. **The bands did not move**: recalibrated against the
same VOT-deleted ablation the original used, 35/50 still sits in the empty gap, now with 25 ms
of margin below and 15 above.

**The chain filter will silently break the stress channel.**  ✅ fixed in 8.1 — `index.html:1225` does
`chain=r.ph.filter(x=>known.has(x))` — it drops any phone the tract cannot say. Check 9 exists
to ensure that filter is a no-op in practice, and it currently is. But `stress` is *parallel*
to `ph`, so the first time that filter removes something while 8.1 is live, every syllable
after it is off by one and the symptom will be a duration bug with no obvious cause. **8.1
must filter both arrays in lockstep, or not filter at all.** Written down now because this is
exactly the class of bug that costs a weekend.

**Open stressed syllables take the long vowel, and it is not a rule.**  ✅ handled as a list.
*peter* wants /i/, *piper* /aɪ/, *lazy* /eɪ/ — a stressed syllable with no coda takes the long
vowel, which is the same mapping magic-e encodes. Tested before writing the rule:

    long   peter piper lazy baby table tiger paper later final open robot
    short  city river seven model lemon cabin robin solid second busy many banana

Identical shape, opposite answers, nothing in the letters to separate them. The rule would have
fixed eleven and broken twelve, and the twelve are right today because "short" is what the plain
letter rules already give. So it is a list of thirty. **Both halves are gated** — the short
column is asserted unchanged, so a later attempt at the tempting rule fails loudly.

**Three speller faults the phrase list turned up, all left unfixed on purpose.**

*Regular past tense `-ed`.* "picked" spells to `p·ɪ·k·ɛ·d` where English says /pɪkt/. The rule
is highly regular — /t/ after a voiceless consonant, /d/ after a voiced one, /ɪd/ after /t/ or
/d/ — and it is the same whole-word shape as the final -y and final -e fixes, since "bed",
"red" and "fed" must not take it. The exceptions are a short closed list of adjectives:
*sacred, naked, wicked, learned, aged*. Worth doing; too big to fold into a lexical fix.

*Magic-e before `-le`.* `^le$` maps to /əl/, which is right for *table, little, candle, apple*
— a consonant then the syllabic -le — and wrong for every magic-e word ending the same way:
*smile* spells to `s·m·aɪ·ə·l`, *male* to `m·eɪ·ə·l`, *whale*, *hole*, *rule*, *style* likewise.
Pre-existing, confirmed identical before and after the -y/-e fix. It is not a one-liner: the
rules only ever match a suffix, so by the time `le$` fires the vowel before the /l/ has been
consumed and cannot be seen. The clean fix is to let the magic-e rules consume through the
final `e` instead of looking ahead at it, which changes the shape of the rule table.

*Final `-s` after a vowel.* Now handled after a voiced CONSONANT — dogs, bells, sells, hands —
and deliberately not after a vowel, because there the spelling predicts nothing: *is, his, has,
as, was* are /z/ while *bus, gas, yes, us, plus, thus* are /s/, and the four function words are
in the dictionary instead. Plurals of magic-e words are a second gap in the same place:
"hopes" spells to `h·ɑ·p·ɛ·s`, because the trailing `s` stops the magic-e lookahead matching.

**Consonant postures are fitted from one speaker.** The fricatives were refitted at the default
tract length with the targets scaled, but everything else — stops, nasals, approximants —
carries hand-placed generic postures, with only the measured voice getting fitted ones.

**Stop bursts are still tuned rather than derived.** A release is a pressure transient whose
strength should follow from the pressure built behind the closure and the speed of the opening.
It is currently a level parameter with a place-of-articulation scaling.

**The two-mass oscillator sounds more robotic than the waveform it replaced.** A symmetric
oscillator settles into a limit cycle more perfectly periodic than the LF path with jitter
applied. It is off by default. Making it sound better probably means asymmetry between the two
folds, which real larynges have and this model does not.

**No prosody above the word.** Pitch is an arc across a single word, and a phrase is words with
pauses between them. Real speech has phrase-level contours, stress, and final lengthening.
This is no longer just a known fault — it is Phase 8, with a build order.

## Note on method

Four times during the earlier synthesis work, a confident diagnosis turned out to be a
measurement artefact rather than a real defect. The offline scoring in Phase 1 exists partly to
stop that happening again: every metric it reports should be checked against a case where the
answer is independently known before it is trusted to judge anything.
